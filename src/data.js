      "This project has enabled me to learn Lua as well as client/server interactions. Because of the game being public, I have learned a lot from fellow developers on ways to prevent exploitive behaviors coming from the client-side. Also, I take data from each round that occurs from the game and store it in a Firebase real-time database. I use this to data to calculate round completion rates, as well as the popularity of the game mode through a Python script. The results of the script are then used to determine if the levels are too difficult for players and if levels should be moved to different game modes to improve player experience. ",
